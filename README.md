# Project - BookApp - Static Page

This project has been completed as a part of JavaScript Front-end Bootcamp @ Kodilla.
Project utilises clean JavaScript and templating library Handlebars. During the project I have learned how to work with DOM objects, apply templates and render changes on pages.

Project has basic functionaloty and renders data taken from the object using Handlebars for templating. 
Double-click on the item enables user to add book to "favourites". There is also basic checkbox filter applied. If user marks one of two-given categories, the rest of the books will be visible as unavailable items.
